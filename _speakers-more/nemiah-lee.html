            <h3><i>Founder and Chairman of Nehemiah Reinforced Soil Sdn. Bhd.</i></h3>
            <h3>Topic: Wall of Integrity</h3>
            <p>
                Ir. Dr. Nehemiah Lee Chee Hai invented the Nehemiah Walls, the well-known, soil-retaining wall 
                made of hexagonal blocks that line our highways. You may see his concrete walls everywhere when 
                traveling down the highways or passing beside flyovers, such as KL-Karak Highway and Second East-West 
                Highway. They had a distinctive feature of interlocking hexagonal blocks and a technology to make a 
                wall to last for 120 years! Getting the idea while working with Reinforced Earth in the 80s, Dr. 
                Lee studied the concept and researched diligently to modify the system in tandem with working on 
                his Mastersâ€™ degree.

                When he first ventured into business, Dr.Lee didn't even know how to read a financial statement. 
                In addition, due to the company's novelty, it became a subject of mockery. "Nehemiah wall? Never heard 
                of it. It will sure collapse one lah" was the usual comment he received. He also faced challenges to 
                hire employees. Instead of interviewing employees, they interviewed him back for company's history in 
                the market and growth because they were concerned that the company wasn't stable. His reluctance to 
                conform to bribery made him lost many projects as he is strongly firm on his moral compass.

                However, today, Dr. Nehemiah sits as the Founder Chairman of Nehemiah Walls Sdn. Bhd., which, in 
                addition to Nehemiah Walls, also works on other related construction projects such as slope 
                stabilization using a geotextile reinforced soil system called GreenMur and the promotion of 
                Segmented Wall, a geogrid reinforced wall with decorative finish, ideal for landscaping. The 
                company has become the recipient of numerous awards such as the Brand Laureate, Red Bull, 
                Ernst & Young and Star Outstanding Business Award from its inception in 1993.
            </p>

            <p>
                Dr. Lee believes in the value of honesty and incorruptibility in business and has never resorted 
                to bribery to get ahead in the business world with his company. Now, the Nehemiah Group of Companies 
                includes Nehemiah Reinforced Soil Sdn Bhd, Anchored Earth Sdn Bhd, Cribwall (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd and 
                Nehemiah Alliances Sdn Bhd. Each of these companies focuses on a specialized sector of the construction.
