            <p>
                Living up to his motto “Think Without The Box”, Robest Yong does not believe in taking the beaten path. 
                In 1989, Yong left his employment and ventured into the world of innovators. His effort soon paid off as 
                he invented the POLYCLONE instant rubber stamp machine, which became widely successful in commercial, 
                used in bookshops worldwide, and revolutionised the industry. It won him an award (first of many more) 
                at the International Invention Exhibition in Geneva, Switzerland in 1994; and he was thereafter named 
                the Malaysian National Inventor of the Year.

                people to use the smart phone. He also produced multiple inventions such as magnetic brush, luggage detector, 
                mosquito glue, TGFree Laptop charger and probiotic plant nutrients.
